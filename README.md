# The Stock Dash

This project is a model dashboard for Stock Value Analysis. The Analysis includes predicting values of stock market indexes in the near future, analyzing historical data of the indexes graphically for any given period of time, crawling the live value of stock indexes and storing these values in the database for future analysis. The dashboard is a web app, developed using Django at the backend and Javascript, Jquery and D3 at the frontend.

In broader terms, the project consists of following parts:

#### 1.Live Stock Values : 
This division performs the function of web crawling for the live value of NIFTY, SENSEX, GOLD(24 carats) and NASDAQ every minute and displays it. Also, every day at 02:00 AM the crawled data is stored in the database in a JSON file. The web crawling is done using the .get function of Jquery Ajax so that data can be stored without page refresh.

#### 2.Historic Data Values : 
This division performs the function of showing the data stored in the database in a graphical format for analysis. The values of various indices are represented using the line graph. Here the programs load the data from the database and then on the basis of this data draws the graph using Data-Driven Documents(D3.js). The graph can also be zoomed to show the historical graph on for any given interval of date.

#### 3.Predict Stock Values : 
The value of stock indices stored in the database are used for creating graph can be used to predict the future values of stock. This division contains date input where one can enter the date at which we need to predict the stock values. For the given date the values of SENSEX,GOLD, and NASDAQ is calculated using Linear Regression and based upon these calculated values the value of NIFTY is calculated using Multi Regression. These calculations are performed using Javascript and Jquery.


## Getting Started

Just download the whole repository in zip format, unzip it. 
### Prerequisites

#### Concepts

```
1. Javascript, Jquery, D3, Django, HTML and CSS.
2. Fundamental of Linear Regression, Multi Regression and Ajax.
```
#### Software and Tools

```
1. Python IDE with pre-installed Django package to set up a server atmosphere. (I used PyCharm).
2. Proper internet connection as web crawling can't be done without it.
```

### Installing

Download all the files of the repository. Create a project in IDE and add the files of the repository to the project. Now run the command prompt and go the directory of the repository. Now to establish the server execute the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
